how you reference with: './'
how you define datatype: variable: datatype;
indentation always 4 space
we use get, save or update prefix to define the nature of the function
always make a variable same like service but camelCase to use service functions
always define all variables like name, id etc in your html as camelCase
always bing angular right after html tag name like: <input [(ngModel)]="bla" />
always address css with its class name
